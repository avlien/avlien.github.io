We thank you for your interest in our venture, and look forward to your participation, however large or small your contribution may be.\r\n\r\n# Projects\r\n## The AVLien Network\r\nThe AVLien Network (working title) is a proof of concept project to show what possibilities open source software and low-cost hosting can provide to art & music communities. It is the brainchild of Durham Bell, who drew inspiration when reading about early iterations of two related projects: [Commons in a Box](http://commonsinabox.org/) and [BuddyPress](https://buddypress.org/), both social networking frameworks based on the [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) content management system.",
